**Tiered Events App**

This project is a Next.js application that demonstrates a tiered event access system. Users are assigned a membership tier (Free, Silver, Gold, or Platinum) and can only view events that correspond to their tier or a lower tier. The application uses Clerk for user authentication and Supabase for the event database.

**üöÄ Features**

Tier-Based Access: Events are fetched and displayed based on the user's membership tier.

Authentication: Secure user sign-in and sign-up with Clerk.

Tiered Content: Users can see locked events above their tier with an "Upgrade" message.

Simulated Upgrade: A button to simulate upgrading a user's tier by updating their Clerk public metadata.

Responsive UI: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.
